abstract = {Land-use conflicts are complex disputes that involve heterogeneous parties as well as environmental and social impacts that are often difficult to resolve. The measures and definitions of success in land-use conflict resolution still need further research. We investigated four cases of land-use conflicts in two countries, Switzerland (CH) and Romania (RO): a connection between two ski areas (CH), a ski track in a national park (RO), a residential project in a sensitive natural area (CH) and a residential project in an area with poor urban facilities and planning (RO). We developed a framework to assess the cases, and used it to address the following research questions: 'How successful is the resolution of land-use conflicts in these four cases?' and 'Which factors contribute to success or failure?'. The assessment was based on criteria and subcriteria related to conflict management and conflict-solving conditions. To identify the criteria and subcriteria that contributed most to successful resolution and to rank the cases we used the Analytic Network Process. Our results showed that Switzerland was more successful in the resolution process than Romania due to more emphasis on sustainability and equity. The low scores of the Romanian cases resulted from the poor implementation of spatial plans and poor enforcement of environmental regulations, little interest in environmental protection and a preference for quick economic returns, and little importance attached to public participation in the decision-making process. For conflict-resolution to be successful our findings indicate that it is important to foster not only economic aspects but also long-term ecological benefits and to take into consideration people's needs. This study should help planners as it identifies key elements for the successful resolution of land-use conflicts to achieve the best use of land. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Renewable energy systems are land intensive at local scales. Appropriate siting can help to mitigate the extent to which RE implementation compromises existing land-based economies and ecosystem services. As such, an integrated approach to land-use and energy planning, or land-energy planning, can help to ensure that RE technologies can be intensively implemented while minimizing negative impacts. Requisite to the development of such plans is (a) estimating total land availability on which technologies capable of supporting RE production functions after considering various socio-political, economic and ecological constraints; (b) identifying potential sources of conflict among multiple RE options; and (c) assessing the trade-offs associated with allocating this land toward one energy system and not another. The purpose of this paper is to address these issues at a regional-scale in the context of intensifying solar and bioenergy production. A methodology is developed from which to (a) locate land that is most likely to support both dedicated bioenergy feedstock and solar photovoltaic (PV) production in an area; (b) identify the point at which mutual land must be used in order to achieve their market potential; and (c) estimate and evaluate trade-offs associated with choosing one system over another at mutual land, in this case total potential electricity production and energy density (MWh/ha), in the context of regional energy needs and existing renewable electricity assets. Mutual land is located through GIS-based land-suitability modeling and map overlay techniques. Comparisons of production potential and land-use efficiency are made for a range of fixed-axis solar PV technologies against two short rotation woody coppice systems (poplar; willow) and two perennial grass systems (switch grass; miscanthus). Rooftop space is found to be sufficient to provide the land area required for solar PV to meet mid-day regional electricity requirements. If all mutual land in the region were allocated toward dedicated bioenergy crops instead of solar PV systems, (a) a 100 per cent renewable electricity system is within the limits of technical feasibility, even in the absence of large-scale storage systems; and/or (b) bioelectricity systems could provide back-up electricity for rooftop solar PV systems. The policy implications of these findings are discussed.},

abstract = {Environmental land use conflicts are uses of the land that ignore soil capability. In this study, environmental land use conflicts were investigated in mainland Portugal, using Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression combined with GIS modeling and a group of 85 agricultural watersheds (with {\textgreater}. 50{\%} occupation by agriculture) as work sample. The results indicate a dominance of conflicts in a region where vineyards systematically invaded steep hillsides (the River Douro basin), where forests would be the most appropriate use. As a consequence of the conflicts, nitrate concentrations in rivers and lakes from these areas have increased, sometimes beyond the legal limit of 50. mg/L imposed by the European and Portuguese laws. Excessive nitrate concentrations were also observed along the Atlantic coast of continental Portugal, but associated to a combination of other factors: large population densities, and incomplete coverage by sewage systems and inadequate functioning of wastewater treatment plants. Before this study, environmental land use conflicts were never recognized as possible boost of nitrate concentrations in surface water. Bearing in mind the consequences of drinking water nitrate for human health, a number of land use change scenarios were investigated to forecast their impact on freshwater nitrate concentrations. It was seen that an aggravation of the conflicts would duplicate the number of watersheds with maximum nitrate concentrations above 50. mg/L (from 11 to 20 watersheds), while the elimination of the conflicts would greatly reduce that number (to 3 watersheds).},

abstract = {The appearance of land-use conflicts represents one of the expressions of the increasing human pressure on the environment, especially in complex metropolitan areas. We used a multi-criteria analysis applied in the Bucharest Metropolitan Area to create a tool for integrating land-use conflicts into the strategies for territory planning at the metropolitan level. We selected ten main criteria for the analysis, divided them into two categories, i.e., spatial indicators and urban development indicators, and standardized their values. Using the method of pair-wise comparison with an expert-opinion system, we determined the relative importance of each criterion in the form of a criteria weight. The spatial indicators reveal high probabilities for land-use conflicts in the proximity of Bucharest (range: 7.19-52.48), whereas urban development indicators show a scattered spatial distribution of land-use conflicts (range: 10.00-30.01). The variability of the total score for the spatial indicators is greater than that of the urban development indicators (standard error of 0.64 {\textgreater} 0.30, respectively). The total scores reveal local administrative units characterized by a critical or high incidence of spatial-land use conflicts as well as their location in the Bucharest Metropolitan Area. Further research should concentrate on improving the expert-opinion input for assigning weights and revealing the potential for replication in other areas or on different subjects. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The number of public participation GIS (PPGIS) applications to inform local and regional land, use planning has increased significantly over the last decade. An important rationale for undertaking, participatory mapping is to anticipate and identify areas of potential land use conflict. To date, there, has not been a systematic evaluation of methods for identifying land use conflict potential with PPGIS data. This study uses data from a regional planning study in Australia to describe and evaluate alternative methods for identifying land use conflict potential. A simple, two dimensional model of land use conflict is presented and operationalized with spatial data to provide a heuristic device for regional land-use planning practitioners. Land use conflict is posited to derive from differences in landscape values and land use preferences that can be formulated into different conflict indices and presented in maps. We demonstrate application of the conflict mapping model using residential and industrial development in the region as examples. The spatial distribution of landscape values, values compatibility scoring, land use preference differences, and a combined values and preferences scoring index are all viable methods for identifying and mapping the potential for land use conflict. The preferred method for assessing the potential for land use conflict is one that integrates two dimensions: land use preference directionality (supporting or opposing) and the importance or intensity of landscape values. We discuss the strengths and limitations of each conflict mapping method. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},
