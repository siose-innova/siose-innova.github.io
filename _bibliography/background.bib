abstract = {Ecosystem services research has become important in fields such as ecology and land planning in recent years. Several authors have emphasized the need to evaluate these services from a spatial perspective. The spatial distribution of the resources and processes that provide ecosystems have also been considered in relation to landscape. Because ecosystem services are provided by different ecological processes, the spatial scales probably also differ; this aspect may be of interest for analyzing the provision flow. In this study, we analyzed the spatial pattern of six services that are important in the study area (in Galicia, NW Spain). We first identified the landscape elements associated with these services, defining them as ecosystem service providers (ESP). To represent the ecosystem, we initially used cartographic information based on land use/land cover (LULC) and then generated two different raster ESP data sets: (i) binary and (ii) greyscale. We then explored the spatial patterns of ESP by lacunarity analysis, which is often used to study fractal elements, and by selecting landscape metrics. The results suggest that the spatial patterns of ecosystem services occur at different scales. We observed a strong relationship between lacunarity values and the different distribution patterns of ESP. Multiscale effects were also associated with changes in lacunarity values. Application of different spatial analysis techniques to study the relationships between landscape structure and service providers should provide a better understanding of service provision and enable evaluation of the ecological integrity of landscapes. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {This paper describes the EAGLE concept, an object-oriented data model for land moni- toring. It highlights the background situation in the field of land monitoring, identifies the team in- volved, explains the technical and strategic considerations behind the concept, describes the cur- rent status of the harmonization and the developments made and outlines the future activities and requirements. After the structure and the content of the data model and matrix are explained, ex- amples are given on how to use the matrix. Besides its possible function as a semantic translation tool between different classification systems, it also can help to analyze class definitions to find semantic gaps, overlaps and inconsistencies and can serve as data model for new mapping initia- tives. On the long-term, the EAGLE concept aims at sketching a vision of a future integrated and harmonized European land monitoring system, which is designed to store all kinds of environmen- tally relevant information on the Earth´s surface, coming from both national and European data sources. Being still in the state of development, some first applications and test cases are under way. This paper also dedicates a chapter referring to the context between the concept and remote sensing in general as well as the relation between land monitoring and the principles of the Euro- pean Commission´s Horizon 2020 Framework Programme.

@article{Ray2011,
abstract = {The volume of spatial data generated and consumed is rising exponentially and new applications are emerging as the costs of storage, processing power and network bandwidth continue to decline. Database support for spatial operations is fast becoming a necessity rather than a niche feature provided by a few products. However, the spatial functionality offered by current commercial and open-source relational databases differs significantly in terms of available features, true geodetic support, spatial functions and indexing. Benchmarks play a crucial role in evaluating the functionality and performance of a particular database, both for application users and developers, and for the database developers themselves. In contrast to transaction processing, however, there is no standard, widely used benchmark for spatial database operations. In this paper, we present a spatial database benchmark called Jackpine. Our benchmark is portable (it can support any database with a JDBC driver implementation) and includes both micro benchmarks and macro workload scenarios. The micro benchmark component tests basic spatial operations in isolation; it consists of queries based on the Dimensionally Extended 9-intersection model of topological relations and queries based on spatial analysis functions. Each macro workload includes a series of queries that are based on a common spatial data application. These macro scenarios include map search and browsing, geocoding, reverse geocoding, flood risk analysis, land information management and toxic spill analysis. We use Jackpine to evaluate the spatial features in 2 open source databases and 1 commercial offering.},

abstract = {The National Geographic Institute of Spain (IGN) is the National Reference Centre in Land Cover and Use (EIONET´s National Reference Centre for Soil, by mandate of the National Focal Point, the Spanish Environment Ministry); according to this mandate, IGN must coordinate the information in Spain related to Land Cover and Use. This new Land Cover and Use Information System of Spain (SIOSE), able to integrate different data of regional and national administrations, is a very ambitious project destined for being a Spanish and European reference as regards geographic information. SIOSE is part of the National Land Monitoring Plan, managed and coordinated by the IGN, which hopes to achieve a multidisciplinary spatial data infrastructure, periodically updated, for the Spanish national and regional administrations. SIOSE is being produced between 2006-2009, in a decentralized and cooperative production model by Spanish National and Regional administrations. This projects has been designed according to the main INSPIRE principles, and ISO TC/211 standards, moving from previous hierarchical land cover databases towards a land cover feature data model, able to describe the different land cover classes in the territory, but also their environmental parameters. This complex and strong description of each land cover occurrence will allow obtaining environmental key indicator from SIOSE data. 1.},

abstract = {Object and relational technologies are grounded in different paradigms. Each technology mandates that those who use it take a particular view of a universe of discourse. Incompatibilities between these views manifest as problems of an object-relational impedance mismatch. In this paper we propose a conceptual framework for the problem space of object-relational impedance mismatch and consequently distinguish four kinds of impedance mismatch. We show that each kind of impedance mismatch needs to be addressed using a different object-relational mapping strategy. Our framework provides a mechanism to explore issues of fidelity, integrity and completeness in the design and implementation of existing and new strategy choices. Our framework will be of benefit to standards bodies, tool vendors, designers and programmers as it will provide them with new insights into how to address problems of an object-relational impedance mismatch both at the most appropriate levels of abstraction and in the most appropriate way.},

abstract = {The last 25 years of commercial DBMS development can be summed up in a single phrase: "One size fits all". This phrase refers to the fact that the traditional DBMS architecture (originally designed and optimized for business data processing) has been used to support many data-centric applications with widely varying characteristics and requirements. In this paper, we argue that this concept is no longer applicable to the database market, and that the commercial world will fracture into a collection of independent database engines, some of which may be unified by a common front-end parser. We use examples from the stream-processing market and the data-warehouse market to bolster our claims. We also briefly discuss other markets for which the traditional architecture is a poor fit and argue for a critical rethinking of the current factoring of systems services into products.},
