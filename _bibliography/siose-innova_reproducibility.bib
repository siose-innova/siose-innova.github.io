abstract = {Datasets collecting the ever-changing position of moving individuals are usually big and possess high spatial and temporal resolution to reveal activity patterns of individuals in greater detail. Information about human mobility, such as â€˜when, where and why people travel', is contained in these datasets and is necessary for urban planning and public policy making. Nevertheless, how to segregate the users into groups with different movement and behaviours and generalise the patterns of groups are still challenging. To address this, this article develops a theoretical framework for uncovering space-time activity patterns from individual's movement trajectory data and segregating users into subgroups according to these patterns. In this framework, individuals' activities are modelled as their visits to spatio-temporal region of interests (ST-ROIs) by incorporating both the time and places the activities take place. An individual's behaviour is defined as his/her profile of time allocation on the ST-...},

abstract = {When conducting research within a framework of Geographic Information Science (GISc), the scientific validity of this work can be argued as highly dependent upon the extent to which the methods employed are reproducible, and that, in the strictest sense, can only be fully achieved by implementing transparent workflows that utilize both open source software and openly available data. After considering the scientific implications of non-reproducible methods, we provide a review of both open source Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and openly available data, before describing an integrated model for Open GISc. We conclude with a critical review of this embryonic paradigm, with directions for future development in supporting spatial data infrastructure.},

abstract = {Computational reproducibility depends on the ability to not only isolate necessary and sufficient computational artifacts but also to preserve those artifacts for later re-execution. Both isolation and preservation present challenges in large part due to the complexity of existing software and systems as well as the implicit dependencies, resource distribution, and shifting compatibility of systems that result over time-all of which conspire to break the reproducibility of an application. Sandboxing is a technique that has been used extensively in OS environments in order to isolate computational artifacts. Several tools were proposed recently that employ sandboxing as a mechanism to ensure reproducibility. However, none of these tools preserve the sandboxed application for re-distribution to a larger scientific community aspects that are equally crucial for ensuring reproducibility as sandboxing itself. In this paper, we describe a framework of combined sandboxing and preservation, which is not only efficient and invariant, but also practical for large-scale reproducibility. We present case studies of complex high-energy physics applications and show how the framework can be useful for sandboxing, preserving, and distributing applications. We report on the completeness, performance, and efficiency of the framework, and suggest possible standardization approaches.},
